## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a field of computer science that use statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to **learn** with data, without being explicitly programmed.

**Traditional Programming** 
- You give some **data** and **program** to the computer to give the **output**.

- Example, You give the computer some x and y, to calculate its sum.


**Machine Learning**
- You give **data** and the **output**, and the computer generates the **program**.

- Example, The computers gets lots of x and y's with their sums, and it finds out that it have to perform addition of the numbers no matter how many of them is given.


## Why use Machine Learning?

Suppose you have to classify an email, if its a spam or not. How would you do it with traditional programming?

You may write very long if - else ladders, to check for every possible characteristics of the spam email, but what if the sender just change the email to outsmart your checks.

With machine learning, you can train it on very big number of email that are spams to get the relevant characteristics of the email, and it can automatically classify the new ones.

Other such use cases:
1. Image classification
2. Data mining
