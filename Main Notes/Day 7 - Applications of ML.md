# Day 7 - Applications of ML

Whenever you ask anyone about the applications of Machine Learning, they will mostly give you some consumer specific examples like chat-bots, image recognition, etc. But the applications of machine learning are more vast in B2B space that we will cover today.

### Retail / E-Commerce

Machine learning algorithms are widely used in retail stores and e-commerce websites. Whenever there is some kind of sales in those stores, they use ML to predict how much stock they will need to satisfy all the consumer needs.

Retailers also asks you for your mobile number when checking out to notice your buying patterns. This data can be sold to third-party advertisers for profits.

Another use case would be for deciding what products should be placed next to each other in the shelves. Association Rule Learning can be used to find correlation between 2 products and place them next to each other to increase sales.


### Banking and Finance

Banks use ML algorithms to determine if the person's loan should be accepted or not. They might do a similarity search over the person and some defaulters.

Also to prevent credit card frauds they constantly monitor the transactions with a ML algorithm to detect an anomaly.

They are so many use cases of ML in finance like insurance, trading, etc.


### Transport

We can take example of taxi services like ola, uber, rapido, etc. They use ML systems to determine the price of fare in a given time range with factors like what is the weather, the time of the day, demand of taxis in the nearby area, etc.


### Manufacturing

Manufacturing companies uses machine learning to find damaged products in production. Also some companies which uses robots to manufacture, uses ML for predictive maintenance which means constantly monitoring the robots with some IoT device to find defects in the robot even before they occurs.


### Consumer Internet

Consumer internet apps like X (formerly Twitter) can use the data / tweets that user post on their apps for sentimental analysis for a certain topics like elections. These app can then sell theses analysis to stock brokers or some other third-party for profits.


As you can tell that the applications of machine learning systems are vast and companies are dependent on them for their future. You can unlock lots of opportunities by learning how to build these system that can change human lives and make a real impact.
