# Day 9 - Data Engineer vs Data Analyst vs Data Scientist vs ML Engineer

### Data Engineer

As a data engineer in a company you will mainly work with databases and data warehouses to provide data access to the analytical team. But you can't provide direct database access to the analytics team.

So, You will create OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) from OLTP (On Line Transaction Processing) databases and further create pipelines to provide the data. This is one of the critical things data engineers do.


### Data Analyst

Data Analyst's main job is to analyse already present data and find hidden relationships among it. In the Machine Learning Development Life Cycle data analysts perform data cleaning & processing and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). They create charts and reports to visualize and give them to the managers.


### Data Scientist

"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."

Data scientist is the full-stack guy in the company, who can do all the steps discussed in MLDLC. But at big companies their role is particular, which is optimizing the analysis result that the data analyst gave you based on the historical data and implementing most efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

Data Scientist should have solid grasp over Mathematics, Statistics, Software Engineering and Communication Skills.


### ML Engineer

ML Engineer is the bridge between software engineers and data scientists. Because the expertise of both of the job doesn't overlap, there should be a person who known machine learning with software engineering to integrate the models into products.

Other than that, ML Engineer deploys and manages the model on the production, integrates them with various software, etc.
