# Day 2 - AI vs ML vs DL

### Artificial Intelligence

In the early 1980s, AI research was referred to the expert systems, which is an example of knowledge-based system.

Knowledge-based system mainly operates on the knowledge base to solve complex problems. It was essentially just a human giving its thinking ability to the program to reason with a lot of if-else conditions.

Example of expert system,

Expert systems include 2 main components:
- Knowledge base - Human expert knowledge in software
- Inference Engine - Program which performs decision making as per knowledge base

But, the expert system were not **actually** intelligent, they were designed to solve just a smaller problems like, playing chess.

Problems which is very complex like Image classification, expert system can't define all the characteristics of a particular object. This is where Machine Learning shined.


### Machine Learning

The main idea behind the invention of Machine Learning is that you make the machine learn itself. In the expert system where you have to specify each and every rule you want to handle, machine learning just make those rule itself without being explicitly programmed.

It uses statistics and mathematics to derive those equation that can be applied to the new and unseen cases.


### Deep Learning

**Is Deep Learning different than Machine Learning ??**

No, it is essentially just the machine learning, Same data, algorithms and outputs. But it is somewhere related to the human biology.

The core idea of deep learning is a perceptrons, which tries to **mimic** the human brain through mathematics.

In complex problem where you have large amount of data, deep learning tends to perform better than machine learning. It also increases accuracy with respect to the data size, unlike traditional machine learning algorithms which converges after certain training.
