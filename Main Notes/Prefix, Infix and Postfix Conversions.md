# Prefix, Infix and Postfix Conversions

## Operators priority

| **Operator** | **Priority** |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| ^ (Power)    | 3<br>        |
| *, /         | 2            |

- Every operators are in between operands.
- Commonly used in programming languages.


## Prefix Operation

Example,
- $*+ pq - mn$

- Operators are before (pre) the operands.
- Used in LISP and tree data structure.


## Postfix Operation

Example,
$pq + mn - *$
$(p + q) * (m - n)$

- Operators are after (post) the operands.
- Used in stack based calculators.
