# Binary Search Trees Intro

### What is a Binary Search Tree?

 Binary Search Tree is a data structure in which the left subtree should have smaller elements than root and the right subtree should have greater elements than the root. Also the left and right subtrees should be BST themselves.
#### $L < N < R$

### Why BST?

Binary Search Trees **generally** have $\log_{2} N$ height, which helps in searching in the tree. Unlike, normal binary trees which take $O(N)$ time complexity, BST take $O(\log N)$ time complexity while searching.
