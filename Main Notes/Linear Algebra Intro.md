# Linear Algebra Intro

## What is Algebra?
-> When formalizing intuitive concepts, a common approach is to construct a **set of objects** (symbols) and a **set of rules** to manipulate these objects. This is known as an algebra.


## What is Linear Algebra?
-> Linear algebra is a study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate those vectors.

## What is a Vector?
-> Vectors can be seen as special objects that can be,
1. Added together and 
2. multiplied by scalars,
   to produce new object of the same type.

-> So any object that satisfies this properties can be treated as vectors.

### Examples:
#### 1. Geometric vectors:

-> This are denoted by $\vec x$, $\vec y$ 


#### 2. Polynomials:

-> e.g., $3x^2 - 5y + 4$


#### 3. Audio Signals

#### 4. Elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$  (tuple of n real numbers):

->It also corresponds to arrays in programming language.

-> e.g., $a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3$


## Closure
Q. What is the set of all things that can result from my proposed operations?

in case of vectors,

Q.  What is the set of vectors that can result by starting with a small set of vectors, and adding them to each other and scaling them?
-> Vector space.
